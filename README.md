# HI-WOA Based on DAG 

This repository contains two main Python packages located in the `src` directory:

- `dag`: This package is responsible for generating a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) that represents the topology of Edge-Cloud nodes and the connections between them.
- `cloud_edge_offloading`: This package contains the main algorithm used to make decisions regarding offloading tasks from Cloud nodes to Edge nodes.
- `docs`: This folder contains the static HTML page with the results from the algorithm - including the charts
